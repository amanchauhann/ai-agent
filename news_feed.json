      "content": "Taiwan's Foxconn, which rose to become a global tech manufacturing juggernaut by assembling millions of iPhones,can now say its main business is no longer Apple as it takes advantage of the AI-boom to diversify its income.\nIts revenue from making AI servers and other cloud and networking products, including for major customer Nvidia, surpassed smart consumer products such as iPhones for the first time in the second quarter, marking the culmination of a shift that began years ago and has swept through Taiwan\u2019s tech industry.\nFoxconn's heavy reliance on the smartphone business has long been viewed by investors as a significant risk, as demand growth for new iPhones has gradually weakened since they were first introduced nearly two decades ago, leaving the top iPhone assembler grappling with slowing sales momentum, analysts said.\nWary of the risk, Foxconn Chairman Young Liu has been championing new businesses such as AI servers, electric vehicles and semiconductors since taking the top job in 2019.\nWhile its expansion into EVs and chips has yet to show a meaningful contribution to its topline, Foxconn's success in AI server manufacturing (the company is Nvidia's biggest server maker) is the result of its early bets before the technology was thrust into the limelight with the advent of ChatGPT in late 2022.\nConsumer electronics accounted for 35% of Foxconn's total revenue in the second quarter, while cloud and networking business represented 41%. In 2021, consumer electronics represented 54% of its revenue.\nThe firm's prudent wagers years back helped it cultivate a now-prized relationship with the U.S. AI chip firm and other major AI players, analysts said.\n\"The company has been in the business for years, meeting higher quality requirements, diversifying assembly and operations across sites, and pursuing vertical integration,\u201d said Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst at TF International Securities.\nFoxconn began producing reference designs for Nvidia\u2019s graphics cards around 2002 and started making general-purpose servers for cloud service providers\u2019 data centres as early as around 2009. Its AI server business with Nvidia is in many ways the culmination of that history, analysts said.\nFoxconn says it is now one of the world\u2019s largest suppliers of both general-purpose and AI servers, with a market share of nearly 40% in each.\nThe company has also shown a willingness to commit investment to a project at an earlier stage than other companies, Kuo said, citing its past investments for Apple and similar moves for Nvidia. \u201cIn long-term partnerships, Foxconn is more willing to take the initiative,\u201d he said.\nFoxconn's plan to build factories in Houston, Texas \u2014 part of Nvidia\u2019s $500 billion U.S. investment plan \u2014 and in Mexico to produce AI servers for the U.S. client underscores this strategy, analysts said.\nFoxconn now expects its AI server revenue would grow more than 170% in the third quarter year-on-year.\nFoxconn and Nvidia declined to comment. Apple did not respond to request for comment.\nThe shift at Foxconn mirrors a broader trend in Taiwan\u2019s technology sector, where companies once centred on consumer electronics \u2014 such as Foxconn with iPhones, and Quanta Computer and Wistron Corp with notebooks \u2014 are now investing heavily in AI servers.\nNvidia partner Wistron\u2019s revenue for January to July rose 92.7%, while Quanta\u2019s grew 65.6% in the same period.\n\"The monthly sales jump for Taiwan ODMs in the first half of 2025 is evidence of this trend,\u201d said Robert Cheng, head of Asia technology hardware research at BofA Global Research, referring to original design manufacturers like Foxconn that contract manufacture products for their clients.\nTheir fast transition into AI servers is also the result of Taiwanese tech supply chain working closely with U.S. tech giants on data centre infrastructure work for a decade now, according to Chris Wei, industry consultant at Taiwan\u2019s Market Intelligence & Consulting Institute.\nHe estimates Taiwan accounts for about 80% of global server shipments and more than 90% of AI servers.\nCheng agrees.\n\"We think this shift toward AI servers, whatever form it takes, is good for Taiwan\u2019s tech industry,\" he said, noting Taiwanese firms' ability to rapidly shift to cater to changing needs from their customers.",

      "url": "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/nvidia-working-on-new-ai-chip-for-china-that-outperforms-the-h20/article69950614.ece",
      "content": "Nvidia is developing a new AI chip for China based on its latest Blackwell architecture that will be more powerful than the H20 model it is currently allowed to sell there, two people briefed on the matter said.\nU.S. President Donald Trump last week opened the door to the possibility of more advanced Nvidia chips being sold in China. But the sources noted U.S. regulatory approval is far from guaranteed amid deep-seated fears in Washington about giving China too much access to U.S. artificial intelligence technology.\nThe new chip, tentatively known as the B30A, will use a single-die design that is likely to deliver half the raw computing power of the more sophisticated dual-die configuration in Nvidia's flagship B300 accelerator card, the sources said.\nA single-die design is when all the main parts of an integrated circuit are made on one continuous piece of silicon rather than split across multiple dies.\nThe new chip would have high-bandwidth memory and Nvidia's NVLink technology for fast data transmission between processors, features that are also in the H20 - a chip based on the company's older Hopper architecture.\nThe chip's specifications are not completely finalised but Nvidia hopes to deliver samples to Chinese clients for testing as early as next month, said the sources who were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.\nNvidia said in a statement: \"We evaluate a variety of products for our roadmap, so that we can be prepared to compete to the extent that governments allow.\"\n\"Everything we offer is with the full approval of the applicable authorities and designed solely for beneficial commercial use,\" it said.\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.\nFLASHPOINT\nThe extent to which China, which generated 13% of Nvidia's revenue in the past financial year, can have access to cutting-edge AI chips is one of the biggest flashpoints in U.S.-Sino trade tensions.\nNvidia only received permission in July to recommence sales of the H20. It was developed specifically for China after export restrictions were put in place in 2023, but company was abruptly ordered to stop sales in April.\nTrump said last week he might allow Nvidia to sell a scaled-down version of its next-generation chip in China after announcing an unprecedented deal that will see Nvidia and rival AMD give the U.S. government 15% of revenue from sales of some advanced chips in China.\nA new Nvidia chip for China might have \"30% to 50% off\", he suggested in an apparent reference to the chip's computing power, adding that the H20 was \"obsolete\".\nU.S. legislators, both Democratic and Republican, have worried that access to even scaled-down versions of flagship AI chips will impede U.S. efforts to maintain its lead in artificial intelligence.\nBut Nvidia and others argue that it is important to retain Chinese interest in its chips - which work with Nvidia's software tools - so that developers do not completely switch over to offerings from rivals like Huawei.\nHuawei has made great strides in chip development, with its latest models said to be on par with Nvidia in some aspects like computing power, though analysts say it lags in key areas such as software ecosystem support and memory bandwidth capabilities.\nComplicating Nvidia's efforts to retain market share in China, Chinese state media have also in recent weeks alleged that the U.S firm's chips could pose security risks, and authorities have cautioned Chinese tech firms about purchasing the H20. Nvidia says its chips carry no backdoor risks.\nNvidia is also preparing to start delivering a separate new China-specific chip based on its Blackwell architecture and designed primarily for AI inference tasks, according to two other people familiar with those plans.\nReuters reported in May that this chip, currently dubbed the RTX6000D, will sell for less than the H20, reflecting weaker specifications and simpler manufacturing requirements.\nThe chip is designed to fall under thresholds set by the U.S. government. It uses conventional GDDR memory and features memory bandwidth of 1,398 gigabytes per second, just below the 1.4 terabyte threshold established by restrictions introduced in April that led to the initial H20 ban.\nNvidia is set to deliver small batches of RTX6000D to Chinese clients in September, said one of the people.",

      "content": "Maryland\u2019s first-in-the-nation tax on digital advertising violated the Constitution, a federal appeals court says, because blocking Big Tech from telling customers about the tax violates the companies\u2019 right to free speech.\nSupporters say Maryland needed to overhaul its tax methods in response to significant changes in how businesses advertise. The tax focuses on large companies that make money advertising on the internet such as Meta, Google and Amazon, who say they\u2019re being unfairly targeted.\nThe ongoing legal fight is being watched by other states that are considering taxes for online ads. Maryland estimated the tax could raise about $250 million a year to help pay for a sweeping K-12 education measure.\nMaryland\u2019s law says the companies must not only pay the tax, but avoid telling customers how it affects pricing, with no line items, surcharges or fees, said the appeals court Friday in siding with trade associations fighting the tax.\nJudge Julius Richardson cited the Colonial-era Stamp Act, which helped spark the Revolutionary War, and wrote that \u201ccriticizing the government \u2014 for taxes or anything else \u2014 is important discourse in a democratic society.\u201d\nThe plaintiffs contended Maryland lawmakers were trying to insulate themselves from criticism and political accountability by forbidding companies from explaining the tax to their customers.\n\u201cA state cannot duck criticism by silencing those affected by its tax,\u201d the judge wrote.\nThe unanimous ruling by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reverses a decision by U.S. District Judge Lydia Kay Griggsby and sends the case back to her with instructions to consider an appropriate remedy in light of the panel\u2019s decision.\nTrade groups praised the decision.\n\u201cMaryland tried to prevent criticism of its tax scheme, and the Fourth Circuit recognized that tactic for what it was: censorship,\u201d said Paul Taske, co-director of the NetChoice Litigation Center, said in a statement.\nMaryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman, who is the defendant in the case, and the Maryland attorney general's office, who is representing the state, declined to comment Monday.\nThe law has been challenged in multiple legal venues, including Maryland Tax Court, where the case is ongoing.\nThe law imposes a tax based on global annual gross revenues for companies that make more than $100 million globally.\nUnder the law, the tax rate is 2.5% for businesses making more than $100 million in global gross annual revenue; 5% for companies making $1 billion or more; 7.5% for companies making $5 billion or more and 10% for companies making $15 billion or more.\nThe Maryland General Assembly, which is controlled by Democrats, overrode a veto of the legislation in 2021 by then-Gov.

      "content": "The WNBA is heading into the final stretch of a thrilling season.\nThe Minnesota Lynx are chasing history, on pace to put up the most wins in a season of any WNBA team ever.\nOn Sunday, Las Vegas Aces star and reigning league MVPA\u2019ja Wilson became the first playerin WNBA history to score at least 30 points and grab 20 rebounds in one game.\nThe expansion Golden State Valkyries are putting together an against-all-odds season that could make them thefirst team in the league\u2019s historyto make the playoffs in their first season.\nBut even as the WNBA grows its mainstream popularity, toxic pranks threaten to overshadow all of this excellent basketball. Instead of the thrilling on-court storylines and budding rivalries, too many WNBA headlines this summer have been about R-rated high jinks. On multiple occasions in recent weeks, someone in the crowd at a game has tossed a bright-colored sex toy toward the court, disrupting play or hitting fans.\nIndiana Fever player Sophie Cunninghamput out a public pleaon Aug. 1 for the behavior to stop. Just a few days later, shewas nearly hitby a sex toy during an away game against the Los Angeles Sparks.\nSuspects, both young men, were arrested following additional incidents inPhoenixandAtlanta. InNew York, the NYPD is looking for a man who threw a sex toy that did not make it to the court but struck a 12-year-old girl.Police shared a photoof a potential suspect, who appeared to be wearing not New York Liberty gear, but a \u201cBeavis and Butt-Head\u201d T-shirt.\nSo what\u2019s going on here? So far, it\u2019s looking like a combination of idiocy, clout-chasing and cash.\nESPN reportedthat the 23-year-old suspect arrested in the incident in Atlanta said it was \u201csupposed to be a joke and this joke [was] supposed to go viral.\u201d\nSo what\u2019s going on here? So far, it\u2019s looking like a combination of idiocy, clout-chasing and cash.\nBut it could be even more coordinated than that. Last week,USA Today reportedthat the creators of a cryptocurrency meme coin say they were responsible for at least some of the \u201cpranks,\u201d which were designed to create buzz around the launch of their neon-green-dildo-themed crypto coin.\nThe creators\u2019 spokesperson denied any intent to harm and said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t do this because like we dislike women\u2019s sports.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s hard not to see it any other way. While the creators pointed to incidents like a pair of Buffalo Bills games in 2016and 2018,where someone also tossed a sex toy onto the field, the crypto promoters miss a few crucial issues.\nMost importantly, there\u2019s a different implication when sex toys are being thrown at women. Not to mention the fact that WNBA games are,by design, supposed to be safe spaces for women, nonbinary people and families.\nBut that hasn\u2019t stopped some on the right, unsurprisingly, from treating the whole thing like one big overreaction.\nDonald Trump Jr. posted an obviously fake but nonetheless surreal image of his father, President Donald Trump,throwing a green dildo from the roof of the White Houseonto a basketball court of mostly Black WNBA players on the ground below.\nFox News regular Clay Travis, founder of the right-wing sports blog OutKick, hasmocked the WNBAfor being upset and postedodds from sites taking betson what will happen next.\nBoth Trump Jr. and Travis have claimed they are out to \u201csave women\u2019s sports\u201d in their zealous attempts to persecute transgender people, and yet they to seem to have no interest in protecting or supporting women athletes who are literally asking for help.\nAnd elite female athletes are far from immune from sexual harassment and abuse.\nIn 2022, former acting Attorney General Sally Yatespublished a report for U.S. Soccerdetailing allegations of abuse by three coaches in the National Women\u2019s Soccer League, as well as a widespread culture of harassment. And the millions paid to Larry Nassar\u2019s victims came after high-profile gymnasts includingSimone Biles and Aly Raismansaid the FBI did not properly follow up on their claims of Nassar\u2019s misconduct.\nHopefully, this incredibly stupid trend has finally played itself out.  With a few weeks left before the playoffs, WNBA players deserve so much better than to be exploited for some childish misogyny. And so do their fans.",

      "content": "The Trump administration is in talks to take a 10% stake in Intel by converting some or all of the struggling company's Chips Act grants into equity, Bloomberg News reported, citing a White House official and other people familiar with the matter.\nShares of Intel closed about 3.7% lower on Monday, after rallying last week on hopes of U.S. federal support.\nA 10% stake in the American chipmaker would be worth about $10 billion.\nIntel has been slated to receive a combined $10.9 billion in Chips Act grants for commercial and military production, and the figure is roughly enough to pay for the government's holding, according to the Bloomberg report on Monday.\nIntel declined to comment on the report, while the White House did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters could not immediately verify the report.\nMedia reports said last week that the U.S. government may buy a stake in Intel, after a meeting between CEO Lip-Bu Tan and President Donald Trump that was sparked by Trump's demand for the new Intel chief's resignation over his ties to Chinese firms.\nFederal backing could give Intel more breathing room to revive its loss-making foundry business, analysts have said, but it still suffers from a weak product roadmap and challenges in attracting customers to its new factories.\n\"The fact that the U.S. government is stepping in to save a blue-chip American company likely means that Intel's competitive position was much worse than what anybody feared,\" said David Wagner, head of equity and portfolio manager at Intel shareholder Aptus Capital Advisors.\nWagner added that while he was skeptical about the U.S. government investing taxpayer money into U.S. companies, it was better than having Intel become a state-owned entity.\nAptus Capital Advisors holds 80,581 shares of Intel.\nTrump, who said the meeting with Tan was \"very interesting\" one, has taken an unprecedented approach to corporate interventions.\nHe has pushed for multibillion-dollar government tie-ups in semiconductors and rare earths, such as a pay-for-play deal with Nvidia and an arrangement with rare earth producer MP Materials to secure critical minerals.\n\"The U.S. government is taking a China card here and trying to have a little more control over some of the production that these companies are having,\" said Clark Geranen, chief market strategist at CalBay Investments.\nGeranen added that, from a free-market point of view, it is something to be concerned about, but companies are pragmatically cooperating with the new administration, expecting it may be short-lived.\nThe U.S. government has previously taken equity stakes in companies under stress. During the 2007-2009 financial crisis, it took a stake in General Motors \u2014 later exiting the stake in 2013.\nIntel last year secured nearly $8 billion in subsidies, the largest outlay under the act, to build new factories in Ohio and other states as former CEO Pat Gelsinger bet on them to restore the company's manufacturing edge.\nTan, however, pared back such ambitions, slowing construction in Ohio. He plans to build factories based on demand for the services, which analysts have said could put him at odds with Trump's push to shore up American manufacturing.",

      "content": "Users of the crypto exchange WazirX have voted once more in favour of a proposed restructuring scheme, announced the company this week, with supporters now hoping that the Singapore court will allow the proceedings to move forward so that asset recoveries can begin.\n\u201cWith around 95.7% of participating Scheme Creditors voting in favor of the proposed Amended Scheme, the revote has surpassed the strong support received from Scheme Creditors in the last voting round,\u201d noted WazirX in a press release, adding that 149,559 scheme creditors holding $206,892,988.7 in approved claims participated in the revote.\n143,190 scheme creditors representing $195,751,998.5 in approved claims cast a vote in favour of the amended scheme, per the company.\nAccording to the amended scheme, the distribution of recoveries to \u201cScheme Creditors\u201d will be managed through Zanmai India, which is a reporting entity under the Financial Intelligence Unit of India.\nIn July 2024, WazirX lost more than $230 million after a\u00a0multi-signature wallet it was managing with Liminal was hacked. The company responded by blocking access to users\u2019 crypto and advancing its restructuring exercise through the Singapore legal system. The process is ongoing, as crypto investors anxiously wait to learn how much of their assets will be returned to them.\nWazirX previously reported that 93.1% of voting creditors representing 94.6% in value had voted in favour of the first proposed plan. However, the exchange announced in early June that the\u00a0Singapore High Court issued an order declining to approve its proposed restructuring plan.\u00a0After this development, a second voting exercise was arranged.\nWazirX has been criticised for its delay in informing investors about the hack that took place over a year agoand for blocking users\u2019 access to their crypto. Many investors were further distressed to learn about WazirX\u2019s ongoing ownership dispute with Binance, as well as the company\u2019s decision to take its restructuring exercise to Singapore instead of resolving the matter within India.\n\u201cA second round of voting having such strong numbers is a testament to our approach towards the restructuring which has been fair, transparent, and the quickest option for users to recover funds. This has been an incredibly challenging year for all of us, and we are deeply grateful for the unwavering trust and support we\u2019ve received throughout this journey. Should the Singapore Court sanction the Scheme, we are committed to restarting operations within 10 business days of the scheme taking effect,\u201d said WazirX founder Nischal Shetty in a press release.",
